## Workstation role
This role will turn a basic install of Fedora into a workstation which is suitable for most work:

  * Run VMs with cockpit-machines
  * Developer toolchain (vim, vscodium, drawio)
  * Office tools (firefox, thunderbird, some libreoffice)
  * Minimal, but still complete Xfce desktop
  * Discord for communication
  * Spotify for music
  * Bitwarden password manager

Some of the tools provided come from native RPM packages, others from flatpaks.
All permissions granted by flatpak to app containers can be managed with FlatSeal.
